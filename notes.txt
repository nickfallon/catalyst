to run: 

npm run dev 

In a browser, go to https://localhost:9000/api/generator/build

The generator connects to a postgres database using the credentials in .env file.
it creates a file openapi.3.0.0.json and writes code to the /api folder to perform SQL queries.

Re-start the app.

In a browser, go to  https://localhost:9000/api/v1/api-docs to see interactive API docs.
you must provide an Authorization Bearer header (any value) to perform calls.


notes:

- BEWARE bad data in the database eg. missing UUIDs! trying to retrieve rows using GET will
trigger the openAPI validator and fail to return any data at all. recommend that NOT NULL
is enforced on UUID columns.


opinions:

- tables are assumed to have an 'id' field of type serial (primary key), 
and optionally a uuid field.

- table names ending in '_status' are assumed to have an id and description column
which are iterated in api/enums/index.js so they can be used in code to refer to status values.
