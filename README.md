# ![Catalyst](logo.svg) Catalyst

A REST OpenAPI generator for node/postgres

## What it does

When provided with a Postgres database, Catalyst does the following:

- Reads all tables and foreign keys in the database.

- Creates an OpenAPI specification from the tables and keys and saves the result to `openapi.3.0.0.json` in the root folder.

- Creates a REST API that consumes the OpenAPI spec and puts the autogenerated code in the `/api` folder. All API endpoints are preceded with the common path `/api/v1/`.

- Creates interactive Swagger docs at `/api/v1/api-docs`.

## Setting up
### Generating certificates

This step generates two files, `localhost.pem` and `localhost-key.pem` in the folder `certs`.
This makes the local web app work over HTTPS

Create a folder called `certs` in the main directory and move to it:

`$ mkdir certs`

`$ cd certs`

Install the `mkcert` package:

`$ brew install mkcert`

`$ mkcert -install`

Generate the key files:

`$ mkcert localhost`


### Update .env file

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and set the postgres connection info.

## How to run

Use: 

`npm run dev`

### Generating the API 

*When running for the first time:*

In a browser, go to [https://localhost:9000/api/generator/build](https://localhost:9000/api/generator/build)

The generator connects to a postgres database using the credentials in `.env` file.
It then creates a file `openapi.3.0.0.json` and writes code to the `/api` folder to perform SQL queries.


### Using the API 

Re-start the app. Express routes are automatically mapped to the generated `/api` folder code.

In a browser, go to  [https://localhost:9000/api/v1/api-docs](https://localhost:9000/api/v1/api-docs) to see interactive API docs.

*Note:* You must provide an Authorization Bearer header to perform calls. (see [Security and restriction of data access](#security-and-restriction-of-data-access) for details).


## Features

Data types are validated and enforced by the API.

Bearer token authorization is enforced for all API calls.

Foreign keys are used to create API paths in the form `/parent/{parent_uuid}/child`.

`GET` endpoints are available for all tables, eg. `/invoice`

`GET by uuid` endpoints are generated for all tables which have a `uuid` column. 

`GET by id` endpoints are generated for all tables which have a `id` column but no `uuid` column.

`POST` (create) endpoints are available for all tables.

`PUT` (update) endpoints are available for tables with a `uuid` field.

Enums are created in `api/enums/` for all tables with names ending in `_status` or `_type`.

Re-running `/api/generator/build` will overwrite the files created in `/api` and the `openapi.3.0.0.json` file.

### Paging and filtering

GET endpoints which take no parameters (so-called 'get all' endpoints) eg. `/invoice` provide optional paging and filtering querystring parameters, as follows:

- pagesize (integer, optional) : The number of rows to be returned. Default is 10. Maximum is 100.

- page (integer, optional) : The page to be returned. Default is 0. If a non-zero page is specified, (pagesize * page) rows are skipped when performing the query.

- filter (string, optional) : Used for searching for specific data. If specified, only rows which contain the filter string in any of the `text` columns are returned. If no data can be found, an empty array is returned.



## Assumptions/opinions

- tables are assumed to have an `id` field of type serial (primary key), 
and optionally a `uuid` field, which should be `NOT NULL`.

- table names ending in `_status` or `_type` are assumed to have an `id` field and a description column which are iterated in an autogenerated file at `api/enums/index.js` so they can be used in code to refer to status or type values.

- `PUT` (update) API calls are not available for tables without a `uuid` field (eg. status tables).

### Security and restriction of data access

An assumption is made that a `user` table exists containing a row for each user, and that a `bearer_token` column is present on that table which is used to identify the API caller by
matching it with the provided authorization header. This means that the API can always indentify the user performing the call.

There are two kinds of API users:

- 'superadmin' users, who have access to everything

- regular users, who have restricted access

In the case of regular users, *restricted* access means that when querying any entity, the SQL
query will always join to the `user` table, either directly or indirectly, if it's possible to do so. The API code generator discovers which tables are needed to join in order to reach the `user` table. This means that for databases where multiple domains, organisations, companies, accounts or other kinds of silo exist, regular users will only be able to retrieve the data in their own silo.

By default, all users are considered to be regular users with restricted access. Users are only treated as 'superadmin' if a boolean column `superadmin` exists in the `user` table and is set to `true`.
